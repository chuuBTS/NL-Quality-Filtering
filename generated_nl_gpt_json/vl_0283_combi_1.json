We had been sitting for about five minutes when we heard something behind us and to the right at a good distance away (several hundred yards at least). There were limbs snapping and tree tops knocking together and then something we couldn't recognize. It started as a loud low moan than rose quickly to a high pitched scream that lasted about 15 to 30 seconds in duration. We looked at each other and we were scared and curious. We tried to figure out what it might have been but we figured maybe it was the trees rubbing together or something similar. It certainly didn't sound like any animal we had ever heard or heard of. We remained sitting there for a few more minutes (2 or 3) when we heard it again. This time it sounded as if it was literally on the other side of the tree from us! It started out as a much louder low moan and rose again to a high pitched scream that lasted at least 15 to 30 seconds. My cousin and I were scared s***less. We were sitting with our rifles loaded and ready to bolt if the creature came into sight or reached around the tree. Like I said, It was so close sounding we thought it was right behind us. It seemed as if everything became real quiet, and then we heard whatever it was move off away from us, crunching through brush. We never did see the creature but then we weren't interested either.

About 2 weeks ago I was walking on highway 17 at about 9:00pm to the nearest store. along the way there is a small creek thats surrounded by wooods that appear to go several miles west of the area. as I approached this section of woods I heard this scattering in the brush. I figured it was a deer or even a wild dog. I went to the store which is about a 5 to 10 minute walk further down the road. as I was walking back which was probably 10 to 15 minutes later the traffic was bothering me so when i approached the same section of woods to get away from the highway I heard an even louder scatter in the bushes about 10 to 20 feet in the woods. I paniced and quickly ran back closer to the edge of the highway. there was no traffic now and I could hear everything clearly. I was too afraid to run so I walked quickly. I could hear this creature stomping through the brush real fast. I would stop for a second to look to see what was following me and it stopped too. I started off agian and I could hear another couple of footsteps that sounded as if it was the size of a bear. I stopped again and it stopped with me. as I approached an area that was partially lit by a company that had an outside light on i could see at the edge of the woods a creature that apeared to be squating down with its long arms in front of it. the hair looked to be about maybe 5 inches long and a light redish color. it looked more ape like than my fist encounter which leads me to believe that it might have been a skunk ape. I still cant say for sure what it was.

It should be a commands structure. One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. Here are two examples from Commands for reference:\n    Draw axes for AVG(Horsepower) vs Year, colored by Origin.\n    Sort creative types by number of movies.\n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"moon_phase\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": \"state\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": []\n}\n\n### Output:"
