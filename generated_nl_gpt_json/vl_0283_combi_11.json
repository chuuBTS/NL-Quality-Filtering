I heard stories when I was a kid.  I was out for a walk by myself on a nice spring day enjoying nature and getting some peace and quiet away from my children.  I like to walk down to the Ninnescah River, so I went to the closest bridge by our house.  I walk quietly so I can hear everything around me, I practice listening to everything and using all my senses when I walk.  I got to the edge of the bridge at the river and I stopped as I saw a figure squatting down at the edge of the river.  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days.  There was no one, and that's when I started noticing other details that pointed to the reality of the situation.  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?'.  That's when it fully dawned on me that this was not a human.  It was covered in a brown hair/fur.  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back).  It just kept opening mussels and eating them, and it would hit them on the rocks to break them open.  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground.  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands.  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was.  When I came back I didn't want to get down in the area because there are snakes around here.  I couldn't believe what I had seen, and didn't tell anyone, even my family, because this is Kansas.  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks.  I tried to get my husband to go for walks with me, so maybe he would see one, too, but he won't go for walks with me.  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!  I didn't think about reporting this to your site until Finding Bigfoot came to the very river I saw one at, and it clicked that Matt was the head of the BFRO and you might want to hear about this incident.  I saw it and I still can't believe it, why would anyone else believe it?  We live a couple blocks from the river, so if any investigators want to come check it out, you are welcome to stay here or base out of here.  I do have three children at home still, but we have a clean, nice, newer house with a couple guest rooms.  If anyone wants to search around the Ninnescah River I would suggest doing it in the spring or fall when we have more wildlife and the weather is nicer.\",\n      \"location_details\": \"It was on the Ninnescah River.\",\n      \"county\": \"Sedgwick County\",\n      \"state\": \"Kansas\",\n      \"season\": \"Spring\",\n      \"title\": \"Report 43843: Observation of a Bigfoot eating mussels on the Ninnescah River\",\n      \"latitude\": 37.40504,\n      \"longitude\": -97.4572,\n      \"date\": \"2011-04-01\",\n      \"number\": 43843.0,\n      \"classification\": \"Class A\",\n      \"geohash\": \"9ydsy33u4s\",\n      \"temperature_high\": 67.9,\n      \"temperature_mid\": 54.625,\n      \"temperature_low\": 41.35,\n      \"dew_point\": 42.54,\n      \"humidity\": 0.65,\n      \"cloud_cover\": 0.42,\n      \"moon_phase\": 0.94,\n      \"precip_intensity\": 0.0,\n      \"precip_probability\": 0.0,\n      \"precip_type\": NaN,\n      \"pressure\": 1010.36,\n      \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy in the morning.\",\n      \"uv_index\": 7.0,\n      \"visibility\": 7.48,\n      \"wind_bearing\": 340.0,\n      \"wind_speed\": 2.72,\n      \"location\": \"POINT(-97.4572 37.40504)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"observed\": \"Me and my brother was fishing in a local pond for bass on a john boat in the evening and we were just talking back and forth when this thing non human or not a bear bent over from the edge of the palmettos and stuck both hands in water and was drinking from its hands .

Last time I was there I smacked some wood planks together and got a response so I figured I would try again. So I stood up and grabbed a piece of wood (we just built their deck so there are pieces laying around) and hit the hand rail of the deck 3 times very slow. I waited not even 15 seconds and got 3 hits back. I was shocked because it sounded like it was no more then 50 feet away. My mom and dad keep a big spotlight style flashlight right by their front door because I refuse to get out of the car without them shining the light for me lol. I'm a chicken I know. But I ran and grabbed the light and started shining it along the woodline and saw tree branches moving... There was no wind so I know something had to be there. Well I went back in freaking out and sat on the couch... I waited about a hour and went back out and was just standing there and heard footsteps off to the side of their house. Again no more then 50 feet away. This time I didn't get the light because I didn't want it to run away...

It should be a questions structure. One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. Here are two examples from Questions for reference:\n    On average, how much was earned by movies of each genre?\n    What's the average production budget of the different rated movies, separated by creative type.\n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"moon_phase\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": [\n        \"state\",\n        \"county\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"mark\",\n      \"c_name\": \"rect chart\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"mark\": \"rect\",\n          \"encoding\": {\n            \"x\": {},\n            \"y\": {},\n            \"color\": {\n              \"type\": \"quantitative\"\n            },\n            \"column\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            },\n            \"row\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"unique_map\": {\n            \"(x,y)\": \"color\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n### Output:"
