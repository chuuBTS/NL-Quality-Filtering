As we approached the thing that we thought was a deer it became very clear to us it wasn't. It seemed to be kneeling down near the base of the fallen tree. It must have heard our approach because it stood up and turned towards the thick brush up the mountain 20 yards ahead of us and ran in an amount of only 10 or so steps into the brush. The only time we got a good look at the creature was when it turned around to run.  It had a sort of manlike head but with a full brown haired body like a gorilla. The air had a foul rotten-like musty smell to it. It must have been at least 7 feet tall with long arms. We were about 30 yards away from the fallen tree.

One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. \n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"moon_phase\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": [\n        \"state\",\n        \"county\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"mark\",\n      \"c_name\": \"rect chart\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"mark\": \"rect\",\n          \"encoding\": {\n            \"x\": {},\n            \"y\": {},\n            \"color\": {\n              \"type\": \"quantitative\"\n            },\n            \"column\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            },\n            \"row\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"unique_map\": {\n            \"(x,y)\": \"color\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"transform\",\n      \"c_name\": \"aggregate\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"aggregate\": \"count\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n### Output:"
