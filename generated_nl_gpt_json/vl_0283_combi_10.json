And I'm glad I found your sight a few years ago. In 1978, my girlfriend (now my wife) and I were driving back from Virginia Beach back to Baltimore on Route 17.  As I was driving over one hill, I noticed a dead animal in the road, on the slower lane about a half a mile ahead.  It appeared to be a large dead dog. As I approached it, I had to change lanes and started to notice a smell that reminded me of muck we use to pull out of the creek near where I grew up.  The odor got stronger and I thought it was an unusual smell for a dead animal, which now appeared to be the size and color of a german shephard. As I drove around the animal, I watched it so I would not accidentally hit it as I went by (it straddled the lane markers a bit).  I also noticed out of the corner of my eye, what I thought was a little old black man, crouching in the woods behind a leafy branch, waiting for me to pass by. The edge of the woods was about 10 yards away, although I can't be sure of the exact distance.  My immediate thought was that he was coming out to get his poor dog that got run over.  So I curiously watched him in my rear view mirror.  What I saw surpirised me. Since the car had a loose rear view mirror, I held it as still as I could to see the action.  The figure came out of the woods, certainly bigger than I had thought it would have been.  But what amazed me was that it reached the middle of the road in three strides.  It looked down at the dead animal just as another car was coming over the crest behind me. It stood in a crouch, with its hands well below its knees, sort of in a monkey like position.  It appeared startled as it jerked its head looking towards the oncoming car, I saw what looked like two long furry ears (possibly dread-lock type hair) swing around, following its head.  My first impression was that it looked like one of those old aviator hats with the long \\\"ear pieces\\\" but with hair. As soon as it was startled by the other car, it turned and took another two and a half steps back into the woods.  What amazed me was the length of the stride. My then-girlfriend asked me what was the matter.  She said I looked like I saw a ghost.  For some reason, I reacted like I just saw something I couldn't explain, and started to to get physically shaken. We stopped a few minutes later at a roadside store in Jamaica, VA and bought a soda to sooth my nerves.  That's when I realized that I might have seen an animal and not a man.  To this day, I can not tell you exactly what I saw.  But it was definitely NOT what I originally thought it was. The combination of the rancid odor, the long quick strides it took, the \\\"floppy\\\" ears, the size (certainly bigger than an old man), and its color (black/dark brown)  now makes me wonder if I saw a sasquatch. Now, in looking at the map, I notice that that part of Rt 17 goes through a swampy, desolate area.\",\n      \"location_details\": \"The sighting occurred just north of a crest in the road, where you could not see the trough until you had actually gotten on top of the crest.

I live on 10 acres of woods. All around me is woods. I was just falling asleep during a cool summer night. The 3 dogs I have lived outside in their pen I built. The dogs bark now and then at night but usually quiet down, being that they are used to noises. They started barking that night so I sat up in bed and yelled \\\"no\\\". They stopped but after a few seconds they were barking very loud and unusual. I thought that it may have been a wild hog that we see every so often. I got up and heard some movement below my bedroom window, which is about 6 feet above the ground. I grabbed my 357 and stood up. I heard something like foot steps but they sounded like a very heavy person taking huge steps, but not running. I took off out the front door and turned the outside lights on with the dogs still barking wildly. I had a flashlight, pointed it where the steps were at, only to see nothing. But, I did smell a strong odor of a skunk but not that harsh smell. I laid back down a few minutes later and finally gathered my thoughts together and called 911. I was wondering how I was going to report this. I talked with the 911 operator and was kind nervous when talking with her. She laughed and said something like its OK, an officer will be there. I didn't want the officer coming to the house unless they were able to find something. No one came, so the next morning came I found myself looking for anything on the ground, no foot prints due to carpet grass that was pretty thick.

It should be a commands structure. One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. Here are two examples from Commands for reference:\n    Make the bars stacked with the ship status.\n    Through a visualization show average horsepower of cars for each country from 1997 to 2011.for country in USA, JAPAN and EUROPE show MPG vs Displacement.\n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"moon_phase\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": [\n        \"state\",\n        \"county\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"mark\",\n      \"c_name\": \"rect chart\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"mark\": \"rect\",\n          \"encoding\": {\n            \"x\": {},\n            \"y\": {},\n            \"color\": {\n              \"type\": \"quantitative\"\n            },\n            \"column\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            },\n            \"row\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"unique_map\": {\n            \"(x,y)\": \"color\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"transform\",\n      \"c_name\": \"aggregate\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"aggregate\": \"count\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n### Output:"
