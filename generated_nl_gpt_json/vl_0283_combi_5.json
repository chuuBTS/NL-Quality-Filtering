It would be better to talk to me but i'll do my best.  I was road hunting up by doty washington in the woods in an area that had been closed to motorist traffic for the last 3 yrs.  I drove to the end of the road in a small clearcut that had grown up a bit.  Saw nothing, no birds, no animals, no tracks, which i thought was weird, so i was looking down at the side of the road to look on the downhillside for tracks and i saw something black move real close.  Then this thing stood up and looked at me and i stopped the truck and froze. It was realy close like 15 feet on a downhill slope that was steep and this thing was almost at my level. it was very thick and very tall like over 8 feet tall and very broad across the shoulders.  It seemed as nervous as I was. it moved side to side and was moving its arms around.  I then said something like oh my god and then it blew its checks way up and muttered something wierd and i said something i can't remember. then it screamed very loud at me which made me scream if fear and then it turned and stepped up on a stump and jumped downhill. i floored the truck and went back to my son and his girlfriend about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away where i had left them to watch for deer. I was very scared and upset.  I waited to tell them but i was scaring them with how upset i was. so about an hour later i told them. Thats when they told me that they had heard a weird scream from the direction that i had come from.  My son wanted to go look for tracks and i said no but he finaly talked me into it.  So we went back to the spot and it was very dark by now. we stayed in the truck but had every thing off but the lights.

That brought one of my brothers into the house to alert the rest of the family to \\\"Come hear this.\\\" We went outside & stood in the driveway, and heard the most frightening guttural roar you can imagine! This accompanied the pounding on the wood object. This lasted several minutes. The evening was clear, warm, without wind. I do not remember a moon. Neither brother could explain what was happening and I recall being scared out of my wits! When the sounds subsided, the family returned inside. The incident was not discussed in front me again. As a child, I was privledged to live in this remote beautiful area and allowed to run free. Sometime later, a boy friend & I observed what we were told must have been a bear in a thicket of alder trees near the house. The feces found there later contained crawdad shells and berry seeds, with a horrible odor, but the creature we saw was not a bear. The hard dry ground showed no tracks. Our fathers were loggers and we were well versed in the local wild life. While this all happened a very long time ago, I still get cold chills remembering those sounds. Years later, my fiance & I were driving North on Oregon's Hwy 101 near Cape Perpetua North of Florence, OR. The highway is narrow, two lane, with Pacific Ocean on the West & steep rock cliffs on the East. I was watching the moon over the ocean, turned sidewise, facing the ocean. A very large black creature rose from a cleft in the cliff and towered over the little car we were in. My fiance yelled \\\"What the hell was that?\\\" I only caught a glimpse of the thing through my peripheral vision, but it was huge and very fast. I suppose we surprised it as much as it surprised us. It terrified me. My fiance searched for a place to turn around as he wanted to go back, and I refused to let him. We were armed with what suddenly seemed to be a very small weapon, considering the size of the creature! When we returned home, my fiance told his father about the encounter. His father told us of the rancher at the foot of the Capes (Also on Hwy 101) who had been riding to check on his cattle when he heard a cow bellowing in agony. His horse became nervous but he forced it on and found a very large  hairy animal chewing on the live cow. He carried a 30.06 rifle and shot the creature. It stood up and ran off on two legs. He followed until he lost the trail of blood in the rocky terrain. This is the first time I have ever heard of someone shooting and wounding one of these creatures. It is also the first time I've heard of this creature eating meat of any kind. Our encounter was in the late evening with clear skies and a full moon. My fiance saw the creature in the headlights and had a great view of it. He knew it was not a bear, and didn't think it was human in a fur suit. Facial features did not have a snout and the arms were too long for a bear's front legs. I was too terrified to grasp any features. I have never felt fear like that before or since. The rancher's encounter was in broad daylight, clear skies, rocky terrain, no trees.\",\n      \"location_details\": \"About 20 miles from Coquille,near and above the North Fork of the Coquille River.

We were about 1 to 11/2 miles off Hupp rd (which is the road the enters KOP). We set up camp just before dark around 6 pm or so. After about 45 min, my friend went home to eat dinner and call another friend of ours to come out when he gets off duty. Just around dusk, while getting fire started, I heard rustling in woods about 25 yards away. I didn't think anything of it at the time and because of the population of Deer out in that area, I thought it might be one. After about 10 minutes, heard noise again, but it was about 15 yards away this time. I yelled HEY real load and the noise stopped for about 5 minutes. Then I heard grunting about same distance away. Getting nervous, I yelled again Knock it off. I then picked up a stick and said, I have a gun. The noise stopped after 3 or 4 sec and as I turned to look at fire, I heard a loud thump to my right. I looked and saw a large tree stump that landed about 8 ft away. I turned around and faced woods and yelled very loudly Knock it off or  I'll shoot. I then saw another large log come sailing through the air toward my direction and land about 3 feet in front of me and about 5 feet to left. I started running down a trail toward the road. I did not hear anything for about the first 100 yards, and then I heard rocks moving as if someone was running in the same direction as I, but they were on the RR tracks to my left. The sounds of the steps were about 1 sec. apart. I heard this for about 8 to 10 sec. then it stopped. I ran for about 25 more yards and stopped. It was dark and overcast skies, but still there was enough light to see where I was running. I turned and looked behind me and then to my left and saw nothing. I then turned back toward the road and focused on the street light ahead. Walking very fast now, I came to a dip in the trail. This is where I saw it, a large figure standing in front of me. The dip in the trail sloped down to about 3 feet deep and ran the depth for about 30 ft. then it rose again to ground level. The figure was standing in the center of the dip in the trail and stood at the same height as myself. I am 5'9\\\" so I the figure had to be from 8 to 9 feet tall. This thing let out the most God forsaking scream, that it would make your blood curdle. I did what any normal person would have done; I took off running toward my right through an open field. I ran as fast as I could away from this figure. I finally reached my friends front steps about 3/4 miles away. At first I thought it was him, but when he came to door he had been eating dinner, his shoes where off, and his mom said that he had not left the house.  After he ate and our other friend arrived we all went back out there about 3 hours later. The small tent we put up had been tore down and logs and stump that were thrown were lying in the spots that they landed. I have never forgotten this. For years I have dreams, (Nightmares I call them) about the creature and that terrible scream. Till this day I am still scared to go out there. \",\n      \"location_details\": \"This was located just outside of the Kingbury Fish and Game Wildlife refuge\",\n      \"county\": \"La Porte County\",\n      \"state\": \"Indiana\",\n      \"season\": \"Fall\",\n      \"title\": NaN,\n      \"latitude\": NaN,\n      \"longitude\": NaN,\n      \"date\": NaN,\n      \"number\": 2076.0,\n      \"classification\": \"Class A\",\n      \"geohash\": NaN,\n      \"temperature_high\": NaN,\n      \"temperature_mid\": NaN,\n      \"temperature_low\": NaN,\n      \"dew_point\": NaN,\n      \"humidity\": NaN,\n      \"cloud_cover\": NaN,\n      \"moon_phase\": NaN,\n      \"precip_intensity\": NaN,\n      \"precip_probability\": NaN,\n      \"precip_type\": NaN,\n      \"pressure\": NaN,\n      \"summary\": NaN,\n      \"uv_index\": NaN,\n      \"visibility\": NaN,\n      \"wind_bearing\": NaN,\n      \"wind_speed\": NaN,\n      \"location\": NaN\n    }\n  ],\n  \"column names\": [\n    \"observed\",\n    \"location_details\",\n    \"county\",\n    \"state\",\n    \"season\",\n    \"title\",\n    \"latitude\",\n    \"longitude\",\n    \"date\",\n    \"number\",\n    \"classification\",\n    \"geohash\",\n    \"temperature_high\",\n    \"temperature_mid\",\n    \"temperature_low\",\n    \"dew_point\",\n    \"humidity\",\n    \"cloud_cover\",\n    \"moon_phase\",\n    \"precip_intensity\",\n    \"precip_probability\",\n    \"precip_type\",\n    \"pressure\",\n    \"summary\",\n    \"uv_index\",\n    \"visibility\",\n    \"wind_bearing\",\n    \"wind_speed\",\n    \"location\"\n  ]\n}\n\nYour Job:\nI am developing a NL to Data Visualization Dataset. \nPlease help me generate natural language utterance for given dataset and constraints.\nDefinition about the Taks:\n- 'utterance' is what a user would say to make a chart. It should be a queries structure. One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. Here are two examples from Queries for reference:\n    Total gross by genre and year.\n    Compare acceleration vs weight across different countries.\n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"moon_phase\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": [\n        \"state\",\n        \"county\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": []\n}\n\n### Output:"
