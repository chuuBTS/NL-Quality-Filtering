We were parked at a landing waiting for it to get light enough to start. My boss stepped out of the pickup and said bigfoot? I said what? I went to his side of the truck to see what he was looking at.There was tracks about 15-16 inchs long. I put my feet in them and fell about 2 feet short of the next one, maybe 5 or 6 feet apart. The tracks continued like that as far as I could see. We were leaving at dark everyday, and arriving before light, and it was snowing just about everyday or night.These tracks were fresh. My boss seen bigfoot while he was logging on the olyimpic peninsula and was convinced they were sasquatch.I wasn't sure just yet. Later while working I got a chill up my spine and the hair on the back of my head stood up like it does on a dog or cat when they sense something. I began flipping my head side to side trying to see something but couldn't see anything but it sure felt like I was being watched. Every now and then I would wind an animal up wind. Could have been a wolf, I spotted one in the area. I did hear what sounded like someone banging a stick on a tree. I followed the sound expecting to find a wood pecker, but seen nothing. We were seeing around 15-20 deer a day before that, and hadn't seen any after that day. A truck driver coming up for a load told us you should have seen all the deer leaving the hill. There must have been 30 maybe 40 down by the road. I thought it could have been that wolf pushing them down, or they just had enough snow. There was 3 feet on the ground in places and temp. was 15 below 0. I asked a friend who logged in Idaho for years if he ever had the hair on the back of head stand up while in the woods. He said only once. He was running a saw and bigfoot walked up behind him.

One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. \n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"moon_phase\",\n      \"type\": \"quantitative\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"field\": \"state\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"transform\",\n      \"c_name\": \"aggregate\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"aggregate\": \"count\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n### Output:"
