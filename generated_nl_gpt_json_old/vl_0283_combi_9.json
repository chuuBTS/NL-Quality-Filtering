My dog and I were both staring quietly for about 10 minutes and heard nothing else.  After hearing the sound I used my flashlight to search 180 degrees in the direction of the sound.  My dog was with me, he has a strong prey drive though he obeys very well, he heard it and did not move a muscle only stared in the exact direction that the sound came from.  This animal was within 70 feet of me so it was clear and fairly loud (as loud as an amplified siren we use at work).  I went up the following week to look for footprints but I believe it had rained too hard, I did find some but they were too skinny and only about 13 inches long.  I'm not a believer but am very intrigued as the only thing it sounds like is one of the sounds on your site.  Note most of the sounds on your site I find hard to believe.

It walked out from behind one tree into or behind a brush area where she couldn't see it. It was then silent and she couldn't see it. She said it was big like a horse but not a horse. Listen, my wife isn't the type to believe in any of this. But she is freaked out. She brought the dogs in, locked the door and closed the curtains. She is really spooked. It's very unlike her. She said it was one moan then a short little one. A sound she never head before. It was maybe 40-50 feet from our backyard fence. That is very dense and wooded for many acres. I went into that area about 30 minutes later and didn't see anything, couldn't spot prints or anything. Two years ago I was on the deck also letting the dogs out in the winter time and when the wind blew I caught a wiff of a very strong foul odor like a wet animal or something but I had no idea what it was.\",\n      \"location_details\": \"Do not post this information please!\",\n      \"county\": \"Cape May County\",\n      \"state\": \"New Jersey\",\n      \"season\": \"Summer\",\n      \"title\": NaN,\n      \"latitude\": NaN,\n      \"longitude\": NaN,\n      \"date\": NaN,\n      \"number\": 55413.0,\n      \"classification\": \"Class A\",\n      \"geohash\": NaN,\n      \"temperature_high\": NaN,\n      \"temperature_mid\": NaN,\n      \"temperature_low\": NaN,\n      \"dew_point\": NaN,\n      \"humidity\": NaN,\n      \"cloud_cover\": NaN,\n      \"moon_phase\": NaN,\n      \"precip_intensity\": NaN,\n      \"precip_probability\": NaN,\n      \"precip_type\": NaN,\n      \"pressure\": NaN,\n      \"summary\": NaN,\n      \"uv_index\": NaN,\n      \"visibility\": NaN,\n      \"wind_bearing\": NaN,\n      \"wind_speed\": NaN,\n      \"location\": NaN\n    }\n  ],\n  \"column names\": [\n    \"observed\",\n    \"location_details\",\n    \"county\",\n    \"state\",\n    \"season\",\n    \"title\",\n    \"latitude\",\n    \"longitude\",\n    \"date\",\n    \"number\",\n    \"classification\",\n    \"geohash\",\n    \"temperature_high\",\n    \"temperature_mid\",\n    \"temperature_low\",\n    \"dew_point\",\n    \"humidity\",\n    \"cloud_cover\",\n    \"moon_phase\",\n    \"precip_intensity\",\n    \"precip_probability\",\n    \"precip_type\",\n    \"pressure\",\n    \"summary\",\n    \"uv_index\",\n    \"visibility\",\n    \"wind_bearing\",\n    \"wind_speed\",\n    \"location\"\n  ]\n}\n\nYour Job:\nI am developing a NL to Data Visualization Dataset. \nPlease help me generate natural language utterance for given dataset and constraints.\nDefinition about the Taks:\n- 'utterance' is what a user would say to make a chart, it can be a question or a command. One NL 'utterance' is in one or two sentences. \n- 'given dataset' is in form of column names, column type, range/unique values of the column.\n- 'constraints' are information about the chart that should be included in the utterance. \n    So we can find a reference phrase in the NL utterance that corresponds to the given constraints. \n- 'reference phrase' can be explicit, ambiguous, and by_value. 'ambiguous' means the phrase can map to more than one columns in the dataset, always a hypernym of column names(depending on the dataset values).\n    For example:\n    {\"column\": \"gdpPercap\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"GDP per capita\"},\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"continent\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n    {\"column\": [\"country\",\"country_short_name\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"countries\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"point chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"scatter plot\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"mark\", \"c_name\": \"arc chart\", \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"pie chart\"}\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for countries Iceland and Norway\"},\n    {\"c_type\": \"transform\",\"c_name\": \"filter\",\"c_list\": [{\"field\": \"country\",\"oneOf\": [\"Iceland\",\"Norway\"]}],\"nl_ref_type\": \"by_value\",\"nl_ref_phrase\": \"for Iceland and Norway\"},\n- the 'nl_ref_phrase' for 'ambiguous' columns should be equally near all ambiguous columns, not too near to one of the column since it would not be ambiguous.\n    good example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"location\"}\n    bad example: {\"column\": [\"country\",\"region\"], \"nl_ref_type\": \"ambiguous\", \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"region\"}\n- You only include given constraints and no other information. \n    For example, if a column name is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n    Also, it a chart mark or chart encoding channel is not in the given constraint, it will not be included in the NL utterance.\n- all 'nl_ref_phrase' shoule be included in the 'nl_utterance'. \n\nThe output format is identical to the input format, but fill in the str blanks(\"...\").\n### Input:\n{\n  \"nl_utterance\": \"...\",\n  \"encoded_fields\": [\n    {\n      \"field\": \"state\",\n      \"type\": \"nominal\",\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"c_type\": \"mark\",\n      \"c_name\": \"rect chart\",\n      \"c_list\": [\n        {\n          \"mark\": \"rect\",\n          \"encoding\": {\n            \"x\": {},\n            \"y\": {},\n            \"color\": {\n              \"type\": \"quantitative\"\n            },\n            \"column\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            },\n            \"row\": {\n              \"ignore\": true,\n              \"type\": \"nominal\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"unique_map\": {\n            \"(x,y)\": \"color\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"nl_ref_type\": \"explicit\",\n      \"nl_ref_phrase\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n### Output:"
