As the day wore on toward evening and he didn't come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars. There he saw a sasquatch walking across the tundra, with long, smooth steps and with dark hair flowing from its shoulders, bouncing behind \"like a cape\" at every step. The sasquatch paid no attention to the boat (distance about 1,000').",

        "observed": "My son and I were turkey hunting on BLM land near Fort Carson, CO. We arrived in the area around 0930hrs. My son is only 3 and 1/2 years old, so we were moving slowly to find a good spot to set up. We were approximately 500 yards off the west side of Sate Hwy 115 in the Table Mountain area. We found a decent site to set up on and started our hunt. I called a few times with my diaphram calls and we heard one turkey gobble about 100yds away. My sun was busy playing with rocks right next to our site. At about 1030hrs I noticed a truck driving down a dirt road that runs through the area. I watched the truck drive through the area and as it turned down a left hand bend in the road, I caught some movement out the corner of my right eye. The movement was approximately 600yds away. I picked up my binoculars to get a better look, hoping it was a turkey coming in to my calls. When I got focused on the object, it definately appeared larger than a turkey, so I checked it out more and focused the lenses better. What I saw, I don't know for sure, but it appeared to be walking upright on its hind legs and and was covering a great deal of ground in a short span of time but was not running. I estimated the being to be approximately 6-7ft in height. It was walking northwest from my location. After about a minute or two it disappeared into some high brush and thickets. That terrain went up and over a little rise. I did not see anything else after that. We left the area about an hour later. I was shakin a little bit from excitement, but didn't want to hang around too much longer. I have told no one of this thinking myself to be a little crazy at the time, but I know I wasn't seeing things and it actualy hapened. I only tell this now to get it off my chest and let you guys determine if what I have said and seen is true or not. The temperature was warm and the sky was clear and sunny.",

        "observed": "The incident in question took place in the summer of 1984 when I was 11 years old. It was around ten in the evening and I was watching TV when all of a sudden some noises like that of a grunting dog came near. the living room window was wide open, and I remember being scared at the strange noises.The grunting noises came by the house and I turned in the chair and saw a large dark upright object pass by. The neighborhood dogs went wild, and a foul scent came with the creatures passing. I was extrememly agitated at the view that I got because I knew that it was not a man as it was too large, nor was it a bear because of the way it was walking. There were other sightings that night from the neighbors, and we came to the conclusion that it must have been a Bigfoot. My brother, about five years ago witnessed what he swears to be a Bigfoot while driving down Country Club Road in Minocqua, Oneida County, Wisconsin. I believe that there is such a hominid creature among us. There have been numerous instances in that area where people have claimed to have seen Bigfoot.",

        "observed": "While working in the crawl space under a house, I noticed movement outside 2-3 times. The last time I observed the back part of a foot, including an ankle and the lower half of a calf. It was black or very dark brown.  It was full daylight outside, perhaps 2 PM. The distance was about 30 feet. It was moving out of my view with no sound at all.  It was definitly human(oid) and not a dog, cow, or whatever, and maybe 8 feet tall, maybe more. There is a 'stick structure' near the house, hidden from direct view in the woods.  On many occasions, 8-10 times, both day and night, I have heard a barking or 'yip' sound, similar to a dog, from the site of the stick structure. I believe the stick structure to be a nest of sorts and the home location of some woodland creature. Guess who? 2-3 times I have heard 'tree knocking' sounds.  Once, I heard two knocks about 30 seconds and some distance apart approaching the nest area.  This thing is fast, about the pace of a man jogging.  On several occasions I have observed unusual behavior of other wildlife. Hearing an owl at night hooting from near the nest area-no big deal.  Hearing an owl in full daylight at 4-6PM making a fuss, not hooting, from a very different location-unusual? Once, 2 small deer were foraging very near the house in full view 30 feet away near dusk. There was noise nearby of something heavy moving about behind them and hidden from my view.  I have heard this same heavy movement, near the owl hooting location, about six or 8 times, day and night. Unusual? Would a large primate herd deer the way we herd sheep? Riding a minibike back from the neighbor's house at noontime, 1 huge and 2 large deer, 3 total, who flushed well in front of me, in full view, but not away from me.  Perhaps they were more concerned with what was behind them than the guy on a minibike.  Unusual? 4 to 6 times I have heard neighbor dogs go OFF a few minutes after I have been outside smoking. While walking to the neighbor's house a normally very calm and friendly dog alerted very aggressively to me walking up.  Not the same response I get as approaching on a minibike at all.  Unusual? One night at midnight I was awakened to the sound of a commotion outside the house. The sound was similar to a 3 or 4-way catfight with the 'yip' sound going all at once.  Similar to a catfight, but NOT a catfight.  When I went to a window to investigate, the noise stopped suddenly when I came into view.  The distance was 30 feet, the window was open, and I could have heard a beanbag drop from the location of the sound yet heard nothing more-no scurry of little feet, nothing. The next morning there was very little wind and a smell similar to a skunk wafting about. Unlike a skunk, not quite the edge to it, and the smell went away within an hour.",

I took my dog out for a walk for the first time ever, as we got to the very first fork in the trails my dog became very scared like he smelled something but I couldn't. So I took the plum tree trail which goes off to the right and next to a very large ravine. As I got closer to the spill way of it my dog would not move as he was looking at something at the bottom of the ravine. I watched for about thirty seconds and then it moved. It was  tall and lean like a track runner. As he turned he saw me, no sound but just wide eyed and opened mouthed. As I backed up he took two steps toward me, that is when my dog barked a very forceful bark that then it stopped and took a step back as I got farther back. I turned and walked very gingerly out of there. As I did i could hear it climb the wall of the ravine in like two steps then through the woods. We left and we have gone back but no face to face like that but whoops and wood knocks",
