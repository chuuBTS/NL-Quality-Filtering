As the day wore on toward evening and he didn't come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars. There he saw a sasquatch walking across the tundra, with long, smooth steps and with dark hair flowing from its shoulders, bouncing behind \"like a cape\" at every step. The sasquatch paid no attention to the boat (distance about 1,000').",

The thing was very large, dirty white, taller than the street sign that was near, and fury and I could tell it was not human or anything I had ever seen before, it scared me so bad I had tears in my eyes and started shaking and at that time I went straight home and told my husband about it.",

        "observed": "I am not sure that I had sighting. The reason I am writing this is because I listened to the \"Whoops and Knocks\" recording from CA, and it reminded me of what I heard while I was hunting on Tuesday afternoon. I was hunting with friends in the Swan Valley of MT. I do not know the exact location, because we were in the backwoods, and traveling on back roads off of Highway 83. We were on the east side of the highway north of Condon and I beleive south of town Swan. My Partner and I split up (our other partner was in his truck up the road). He was to my left 150 yards and in front of me by 200 yards. I saw something brown in the corner of my eye pass behind a tree to my right, hoping it was a deer or elk, I started to head in that direction. My partner contined heading toward and through a ravine. I would walk, and then stop for about 10-20 seconds looking around. I kept hearing a knocking sound. I thought it was a very close woodpecker, but could never see one.Plus it was really loud. After I decided that I must of lost the deer or elk, I decided to head down into the ravine my friend has been went through about 5-10 minute before me. The knocking sound became loud and I was sure that it just was very loud wood pecker, or deer ruttings(The rut is not for a couple of more weeks). The sound always came from the right of me. After hearing knocks on the recording in the Seirra Mountains, I am about 98% sure that is what I heard. Wood or something hitting wood, which also explains the volume and pacing of the knocking. I walked down into a ravine and it got a littel louder. Then all of sudden the knocking just stopped. I decided to go find my partner and walked out the ravine to the other side. I could not find him, so I went back through the ravine, and heard more knocking.I walked back somwhere between 1/2 to mile to our drop off point on the road (I came out about 100 ft to right of the spot), and thought I heard and elk call (which none of my partners heard) but sounds very much like the whoop call after the 1/2 point of the recording. The two men I was hunting with are expereinced hunters and in the woods. It was my second time hunting.  I told them about what I thought was the elk call, and neither of them heard it. When I heard it I was probably atleast 1/2 mile from them. I did not mention the knocking, because I though it was bird, and no big deal. I have hiked/backpacked in Tenn,CT,NC,AZ, The Cascades in WA, Grand Coulee Dam Area of WA, and enjoy being in the woods. This is my first time that anything like this has happened. I will leave the verdict up to you, You are the experts not me. If this was a sighting then great I am glad that I could help. If not then that is fine too",

        "observed": "Back in 1985-86 my family relocated to Coral Springs from Miami before the Sawgrass Express way was built. We lived so close to the Glades my friends and I used to ride our skateboards to the levy and watch the Everglades burn (at that time, some firebug had set quite a blaze). On some mornings we'd wake to cars and yards covered in ash. Needless to say, a lot of wildlife began to migrate closer to our neighborhood i.e.,deer,alligators, whatever. One night we pitched a tent in my friends back yard approx.  50 yrds from a canal that separated us from an apartment complex and across from that was the beginning of the everglades. The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets, some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences. We used to run between houses to cut through to go home. This night in particular, before we called it quits, we played a bit of hide and seek. I remeber hiding under a window box behind a bush and got spotted by an unmarked police car. We really thought we were in trouble, but the police were looking for a person that had been peeping in windows. We assured the police we weren't the perps and went on about our business and went to the tent. 3 kids in a tent don't sleep well, so we were having fun cracking jokes and noticed a sound coming from across the canal approx 100 yrds away. Something was slamming the dumpster lids in the complex across the way and making low deep sounds, grunts. These were tall dumpsters. You'd have to get a boost to lift the lid. We got real quiet trying to listen to figure what it could be. At first we figured a cow got loose and possibly was bumping into the dumpster. But, it became evident that wasn't so. One of the kids I was with turned on a flashlight and started making shadow puppets with his E.T. stuffed animal. Then the thing from across the canal took notice of us for the first time. The grunts were still audible but with what I would say is with a hint of curiosity. We got quiet and real concerned putting 2 and 2 together. Could this be what the police were looking for? The steps grew closer and closer. I remember we tried to figure if it was a quadraped or biped. When the steps finally stopped, the breathing grew louder, then SPLASH!!! Whatever it was was 50 yrds from us and coming right in our direction. We sprinted for the house waking up my friend's family. They were woken by 3 screaming kids at 2a.m. exclaiming something is out there. His dad grabbed his shotgun, turned on the flood lights.  He went out to look around and found the tent was demolished and covered in water. I swear I could feel this thing  right around the corner in the shadows looking right at us. We did not let his father investigate further until morning and couldn't beleive the tent had been moved from its postion. I have no doubt had we stayed in that tent this story would be much different, if at all. I am 35 now and have never forgotten that night.",

Early that afternoon around maybe 1:30 I slipped back into a remote section of woods about 1/4 of a mile from the road where I had hung my stand a few days before. After I got there, I didn't see anything other than a couple of squirrels and an opossum. Right as it was starting to get dark I heard something coming through the woods and I thought it was a deer. Once it got to the small clearing that I was in, I saw that is was a bigfoot. It looked like it might have been about 7 foot but it could have been more or less. I think that it was a female because it wasn't extremely broad or blocky looking and it also had visible breasts. It had reddish brown hair. After it passed through the clearing I climbed down from the tree and got out of there as quickly as I could.",
