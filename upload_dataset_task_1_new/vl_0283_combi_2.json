As the day wore on toward evening and he didn't come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars. There he saw a sasquatch walking across the tundra, with long, smooth steps and with dark hair flowing from its shoulders, bouncing behind \"like a cape\" at every step. The sasquatch paid no attention to the boat (distance about 1,000').",

        "observed": "My hunting partner Ed and I were into the second week of the Oregon bow season. It was about 0600 when we came  upon a stock pond. These ponds are fed by a small spring or small creek. We decided to circumnavigate it to see if we could see what was watering in the area. I went left Ed went to the right. I hadn\u2019t gone far when I came to a depression in the muddy gravely pond edge. It looked like a very big heavy person had left a footprint there. I got down and saw that there were toe impressions at the front. Well I called Ed over to see this and he said there was another one behind the first. We backtracked the prints and found what appeared to be skid marks on the hill side of the pond. This was just next to the small trickle of water which fed the pond. The hair on the back of my neck stood right up. We went up the hill for about forty yards but found indistinguishable impressions in the trashy undergrowth. We went back down and tracked them in the other direction and the impressions (overturned pebbles, broken and bent grasses) went about 100 yards down a hill into a ravine thick with manzineta and small scrub oak. We then went back to the foot tracks and covered them with logs so they wouldn\u2019t be destroyed. Went home and got some plaster of Paris. We made the impressions and we were shocked to find that there were definitely toes on one cast the other was in too much gravel to make a good impression. At the same time I took some pictures of Ed stretching to match the stride of the prints. The next week we went into the same area, same skid road, about 300 yards past the stock tank. We were walking side by side when something to my left and slightly behind us, up the hill aprox.100yards something caught my eye. I spun around to see what it was, and to my astonishment I saw a pair of legs running into the thick underbrush. I couldn\u2019t see all of it because of the trees. My impression was of a two legged creature, animal,  with long brown hair on the legs running away from us. Ed saw the branches swinging back into place but saw nothing else. We both got spooked and quickly went back to the truck and never hunted there again. I gave the plaster cast to my nephew in San Jose California and have never seen them again. I still have the photos of Ed stretching to match the stride. The foot prints measured 18\" long By 6\" across the heel, and 8\" across the ball of the foot. I got some hair samples from a star thistle down in the ravine and I still have them. Other comments: I'm an exited typist once I get started I type to beat the band, I can't spell  worth a darn. I love this site and look forward each day for the BFRO.",

        "observed": "I and my husband have been visiting the Lake Quinault, WA area for the past 5 summers, for up to 10 days at a time. This past June,2003, around the 17th, about 5 PM, we were hiking the Quinault Rainforest Nature Trail,on the south shore of the lake, down at the Cedar Bog area. While at the bog, something dark and large moved behind the reeds/ tall plants there, about 10 yards from where we stood. It could have been a bear, or something that had been crouched down looking for something.Whatever it was, it moved away, and we never got a [good] glimpse of it. On June 19th, we took the hike up to Wolf Bar around 5 o'clock P.M. Twice,on our way up, we heard what sounded like rapping/ tapping on a hollow log, back towards the places on the trail where we had already hiked. Since there was a herd of Roosevelt elk in the area, we didn't think too much about it. When we got to the end of the main trail, we stayed about 15 minutes just enjoying the quiet. There were no other hikers that we passed. We decided to turn back when we began to smell a strange, not very pleasant smell, and heard 3 knocks on what seemed to be hollow wood (this time the sound came from just past the end of the main trail, where we hadn't been.) I kind of joked about the smell, thinking that it was only the shallow water in the stream there. But we had remained at the same place near the trail end, and had not smelled that smell during the prior 15 minutes. The next day, about 7:00 P.M. we took the short hike to Irely Lake. On our way back, the sunlight was getting fairly dim, so we had to watch where we were walking. About 3/4 of the way back, we heard this tremendous sustained roar-growl sound - almost like it was out of a science fiction movie. Not like any bear that we've heard, and certainly not at all like a mountain lion. It was loud, but seemed to be somewhat distant - perhaps 100 or so yards off in the forest. And it never repeated itself. We scurried back to our car and drove home. We hesitated about reporting this, simply because we love that area and were worried about what publicity would do to the area if indeed a bigfoot/ family of bigfeet were found there. However, I know that if one is ever to be found and photographed, sightings and noted sounds need to be reported.",

        "observed": "While we were tent camping at Waldo Lake in the Oregon Cascades, at about 4 am we heard a moaning howl. My wife woke me up and said that there was a bear in the camp. I heard the howl and had no idea what kind of animal made that noise. Another camper a few hundred feet away had dogs that starting going crazy barking. The howling went on for about 20 minutes to a half hour. Our German shepherd started growling. We got up and got in the car with our sleeping bags still thinking it was a bear. At about 5 am and still dark, the other camper left in a hurry in his pickup. It looked like he lit about a half gallon of Coleman fuel in his fire pit. The flames were probably 6 feet tall. We did not see or hear anything else that night. The next day I walked around and looked for signs of the animal. I walked around the other camp and did not see anything. We joked about bigfoot coming that night but I was shocked this last year when I was listening to some of the bigfoot recordings on this site and then heard the moan howl from Columbiana, OH.

I was thinking that it could have been a trick of lighting and the wind moving some branches as the only time I seemed to be seeing movement was when I was looking straight ahead to the north the direction the Blazer was headed and this was out of the corner of my right eye to the east and every time I would move my head to the right it would stop. I played this game for a while, but decided that if I was really seeing something, that I was going to have to turn my head to the right. I dozed off for a while and when I awoke I was still looking off to the right (east) and there was something peeking around a tree that was closer more like 15' or so, so I just kept my eyes on the object and was able to make out!that it was tall, hairy, light coloring in the face except for the eye and mouth area. It didn't move but just like a shifting of feet once in a while. It didn't advance any more, but seemed intent on watching what was going on or in seeing just what it was that it was looking at. I couldn't smell anything as the wind was blowing to the east. I didn't awake anyone because I didn't want to scare them. I didn't feel threatened, but I wasn't going to go and check it out either. At 3:30 help arrived and so I concentrated on what needed to be done to get the broken-down rig off the hill.",
