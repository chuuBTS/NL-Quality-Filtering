As the day wore on toward evening and he didn't come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars. There he saw a sasquatch walking across the tundra, with long, smooth steps and with dark hair flowing from its shoulders, bouncing behind \"like a cape\" at every step. The sasquatch paid no attention to the boat (distance about 1,000').",

At first I thought it was a back bear until I came to a large open field on top of the mountain. I had walked out of the heavy timber on a trail to an open field (the moon was very bright almost like daylight in the field , it was very easy to see my surroundings). I walked to the middle of the field, sat and waited, and nothing happened. So I continued on, reaching the heavy timber on the other side of the field on the trail. I turned and looked back and noticed a large black bump sitting where I waited just moments ago. Then it stood up and walked right at me. Then I said \u201cHey you\u201d in a loud voice. Then it turned and it walked or ran very fast directly to the north into the timber. No noise, but it looked to be like a bear due to the heavy coat. But when do bears walk like humans? And it had a large swinging motion on the torso area. Very weird. So I'm afraid really to tell this story because I do not want my friends or family to know about this. It's such a weird thing to tell people.",

        "observed": "It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn\u2019t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn\u2019t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was \u201csomeone\u201d in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling \u201cif there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.\u201d My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90\u2019s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. I\u2019m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

        "observed": "After remaining quiet about this for over ten yrs, here is what happened to us. My wife and I and 10-yr-old daughter were at a birthday party at (edited).  We were the last to leave. We backed out of the drive, lights still off so as to not flash them into the neighbor's trailer. As I headed towards M-20, I reached for the lights... at the same time, we all spotted a large striding figure approaching the road from the east. The fluid motion of the creature stunned me and I only managed to turn on the parking lights before it took two strides and passed directly in front of the car. I had jammed on the brakes and came to a stop. In three more strides the creature stood across the road where a trail led into the woods (behind the church on the corner). It's eyes glowed green at us as it paused to stare a moment, and then turned into the woods. Stunned, we sat frozen, and then someone said \"floor it...\". I did, and we stoppped at the intersection and looked at each other. I turned the lights on and we agreed we had all seen \"something\", but would discuss it later. The creature stood between 6'5\" and 7'5\" tall, was dark brown in color, had course hair, and a rounded head. The massive ARMS swung at its sides as it walked and it's strides were nearly 8 feet apart. I later measured the site and estimated the strides. We all agreed on the color, height, eye color, head, and strides. It's left hand had been placed on the hood of the car as we surprised this animal...it hurried to cross the road...it's hand was at the level of the hood. So as to not collaborate a story, we all wrote down what we had seen and then compared...that was two weeks later. This was no fabrication, and no halucination. What stirred us from our silence was a report for this county a few years ago, listed here on your site under Isabella Co., Mi., we heard it on the radio and were amazed. The site they reported, on Leaton Road, was only two miles away from our encounter site. Their report was dismissed as \"unreliable\", but the coincidence was too strong. I have a degree in Sociology and Anthropology from Central Michigan University, and I DID NOT take our incident lightly.  P.S. Incidently, the trail leading into the woods follows a power line clearing that skirts houses all the way to Leaton Rd., and then crosses to the north. Is this coincidental also?",
